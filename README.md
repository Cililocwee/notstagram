# Notstagram

Notstagram is a clone of the frontend of Instagram, built using React and Typescript. While it has limited functionality compared to the real Instagram app, it includes a Feed where posts from other users appear, as well as a pseudo-discover feature where users are presented with a random mosaic of images using the Lorem Picsum API.

## Features

- Feed: Users are presented a feed of user-submitted image posts, each including various comments and likes.
- Pseudo-discover: Discover new and interesting content on Notstagram with the Pseudo-discover feature. With a click of a button, Notstagram will present you with a random mosaic of images from the Lorem Picsum API.
- Responsive design: Notstagram's cutting-edge design is not only beautiful, but also fully responsive. No matter what device you're using, Notstagram will adapt to fit your screen perfectly.

## Technologies Used

- React: One of the most popular and powerful frontend frameworks, React makes building dynamic, responsive, and interactive interfaces a breeze.
- Typescript: By adding types to Javascript, Typescript offers a more reliable and error-free coding experience. Notstagram uses Typescript to ensure code integrity and maintainability.
- Firebase: Firebase is a powerful platform that offers many useful services, such as authentication, storage, and Firestore database. Notstagram uses Firebase to manage user authentication, store user picture assets (profile and posts), and enable users to leave comments on posts.
